# Work-Day-Scheduler


This is a simple web app that uses jquery, dayjs, and local storage to create a daily planner that you can add events to. Dayjs is implemented to show the current day and time and is displayed by the colors on the hour blocks. local storage saves the events and displays them through refreshing the page.
